**About the project**

Hello! Welcome to my website project developed on an event of immersion of the JavaScript language, wich we've saw about how js works, it's main operators and structures and how to use it to manipulate the HTML of the page. I initially used the codepen code editor and migrated it for visual studio code on a new repository.

**How to use it**

This is quite a simple project, if you wanna just see how it works, open the link of the github pages and go to the main page. You can add every video you want, but the main goal was to be a movie catalog. So, open a traile, for example, of any movie on You Tube. After that, click on "share" button and click on "embed". So, you may have being seeing a giant iframe tag, so click on "copy" to copy this giant tag.

 After that, go back to the main page and paste this iframe tag into the text area. If you put a wrong text on that area, a warning message will be showed to you and your "video" will not be added on the page, so you're not going to bug my site today, friend(i hope so). If you've done everything correctvely, your movie trailer must have been shown on that screen. If you want to change something, just give a git clone on the repository, change what ever you want and have fun :)
